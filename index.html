  This course will give a taste of the wide variety of uses of artificial intelligence in our society. We first introduce foundational topics including computer languages, data structures and algorithms, recursion, trees and graphs. Then, we will look at how this is applied to current challenges like image recognition, signal extraction in time series, machine learning, natural language processing etc. Students will be coding in Python and will be exposed to the open source libraries available online used in machine learning and AI. Previous coding experience is helpful but not essential.

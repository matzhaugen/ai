  This course will give a taste of the wide variety of uses of artificial intelligence in our society. We first introduce foundational topics including computer languages, data structures and algorithms, recursion, trees and graphs. Using these as building blocks we will build a knowledge base of basic machine learning techniques, like linear regression, and logistic regression, with some light exposure to more advanced techniques, like Neural Networks and Principal Component Analysis. Then, we will look at how this is applied to current challenges like image recognition, signal extraction in time series, natural language processing. The structure is subject to change based on how much we cover in the beginning of the course. Students will be introduced to Python as a computer language. This is a modern language with a highly active developer community with a lot of ideas used in other languages. We will also explore the open source libraries available online used in machine learning and AI. Previous coding experience is helpful but not essential.

1. Get Ipython up and running
2. Make a function using '''def''' that squares a list of numbers and throws and error if the list contains something that does not have a number. 
3. Given the '''1,2,3,4,5,5''' do the same thing as in point 2 but with a lambda function.
4. Devise an experiment to figure out whether list indexing is $O(1)$ time.

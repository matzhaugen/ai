<!-- Here is a link to the [Python/Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) covered in class.  -->

1. Get Ipython up and running
2. Make a function using '''def''' that squares a list of numbers and throws and error if the list contains something that does not have a number. 
3. Given the '''1,2,3,4,5,5''' do the same thing as in point 2 but with a lambda function.
4. Devise an experiment to figure out whether list indexing is $O(1)$ time. Only an outline of the experiment is needed, no code.
5. Make a Python Class called Fraction. This function will contain an '__init__' function that takes a numerator and a denominator.
6. Implement the '__add__' method.
98. Implement the simple methods 'getNum' and 'getDen' that will return the numerator and denominator of a fraction.
99. Make a function that solves a sudoku puzzle. This is the main question for this lab.

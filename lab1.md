<!-- Here is a link to the [Python/Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) covered in class.  -->

The goal of this lab is first of all to get familiar with the python and ipython framework. We will do this by going through some mathematical and programmatic questions. By the end of this lab we will understand:

- Python functions
- Python classes with methods.
- Modular programming.
- How to solve a sudoku puzzle.

# Tasks
1. Get Ipython up and running
2. Make a function using '''def''' that squares a list of numbers and throws and error if the list contains something that does not have a number. 
3. Given the '''1,2,3,4,5,5''' do the same thing as in point 2 but with a lambda function.
4. Devise an experiment to figure out whether list indexing is $O(1)$ time. Only an outline of the experiment is needed, no code.
### The Fraction Class
5. Make a Python Class called Fraction. This function will contain an `__init__` function that takes a numerator and a denominator.
6. Implement the `__add__` method.
98. Implement the simple methods 'getNum' and 'getDen' that will return the numerator and denominator of a fraction.

### Sudoku
99. Make a function that solves a sudoku puzzle. This is the main question for this lab.
